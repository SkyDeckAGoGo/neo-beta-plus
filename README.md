# Neo-Beta-Plus datapack for Minecraft 1.16.5

Neo-Beta Plus is a datapack designed to bring back beta 1.7.3 style terrain into modern Minecraft, with a few new touches added to make modern structures, blocks, items and mobs available and give the old terrain a fresh look.

For more accurate beta 1.7.3 terrain, check out the original Neo-Beta datapack (https://github.com/SkyDeckAGoGo/neo-beta-datapack)

This page is for updates and bug reports.

# Updates
V1.2.1 - 25/01/2021
+ Hopefully fixed an issue where big tree leaves were decaying
+ Fixed snowy taigas and tundras not spawning features
+ Added coral and sea pickles to rain forests
+ Changed bamboo spawning frequency

V1.2 - 24/01/2021
+ Forked project into a new repo. This will make it easier to distinguish between Neo-Beta and Neo-Beta Plus
+ Made some changes to biome distribution and noise variables. Old worlds will have chunk borders when loading new terrain.
+ Added regular taiga biome from beta 1.8 and above. Snowy taiga has been renamed accordingly.
	+ Taigas generate berry bushes and new mossy stone boulders
+ Removed rivers. They looked quite ugly in my opinion and didn't generate the way I wanted. May return if I can get them to look right
+ Removed gravel beaches. Again, not a fan of how they turned out and I can't seem to make them look like they did in the older versions. Once again, may return if I can figure out how to make them look better.
+ Added various types of fish to all forest biomes
	+ fish are rare for some reason though, not sure how to increase their spawn rate enough
+ Added termite hills to Savannahs
	+ A way to get coarse dirt
	+ Experimental, may remove if people think they look ugly
+ Changed lilly pad generation to make swamps less ugly
+ Made sunflowers rarer in plains biomes
+ Made trees rarer in plains and shrubland biomes
+ Changed 'fancy oak' generation to give trees larger, bushier leaves like in beta 1.7.3
+ Fixed issue where grass was spawning in the nether
+ Probably some other minor changes I forgot too. Sorry for the update-drought, been busy with university stuff. Hope you enjoy! :)
